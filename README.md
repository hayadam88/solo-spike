This is my solo project spike.

All it is is a mock representation of what my activity feed is going to look like on the 
bottom of a specific bar's page. This mockup is getting the information from a database using a many to 
many join in my SQL query. I focused on this aspect for my spike, because it was what was giving me the most anxiety going into my project.
